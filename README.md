# REX [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/exponentjs/rex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/exponentjs/rex)

REX is a tool that takes your JavaScript source files and serves a bundle that you deploy to clients. It is a standalone version of the packager included with [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). If you need a JavaScript packager without the rest of React Native, this is your tool.

## Contributing

We welcome collaborators, especially if you're interested in building tools that keep this repository in sync with the upstream React Native project.

## License

The packager is derived from the React Native project. It's [license](./LICENSE-ReactNative) and [patent grants](./PATENTS-ReactNative) are included in this repository. There is also a [BSD license](./LICENSE) for code that is not from React Native.
